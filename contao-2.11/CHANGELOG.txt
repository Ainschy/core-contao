Version 2.11.beta1 (XXXX-XX-XX)
===============================

r1018 (Improvement)
-------------------

Only show the menu to rebuild the search index in the maintenance module
if the search has not been disabled in the back end settings (see #3425).

r1017 (Update)
--------------

Updated CSS3PIE to version 1.0beta5 (see #3454).

r1014 (Fixed)
-------------

Make all e-mail fields in the database the same size (see #3458).

r1013 (Improvement)
-------------------

Make the Database classes independent from the DB_DRIVER constant (see #3452)
and use factory methods in the driver classes instead.

r1006 (Improvement)
-------------------

Prevent setting the upload path to one of the Contao core folders (see #3418)
so the installation cannot be modified with the file manager.

r1004 (New)
-----------

Added a safe operation mode in which only core modules are loaded. It can be
used to debug an installation or to prevent possible incompatibilities after
an update. It is configurable in the back end.

r1002 (Improvement)
-------------------

Disable all caches if the debug mode is enabled (see #3285). This includes
HTML and CSS minification, the front end page cache and the system cache for
getTemplate(), getImage() and __autoload().

r1001 (Improvement)
-------------------

Make display_errors and error_reporting configurable independently, so error
messages are logged even when they are not displayed (see #3338).
