Contao Open Source CMS Changelog
================================

Version 3.0.beta1 (XXXX-XX-XX)
------------------------------

### New
You can now add external style sheets from the files directory to page layouts.
They are then treated like the internal style sheets, meaning they can be added
to the combiner by adding the `|static` flag to the file name.

### Changed
Rewrote all front end JavaScripts so they run in "no-conflict" mode, which means
you don't have to decide "MooTools or jQuery" anymore but can have them both.

### New
You can now choose jQuery instead of MooTools in the front end. Also, there is
a jQuery mediabox alternative called "colorbox" (template `j_colorbox`).

### Changed
Modified the plugins folder structure to prepare for jQuery support.

### Changed
Split the models into `Model` (single record) and `ModelCollection` (multiple
models) to have a "cleaner" implementaion (thanks to Andreas Schempp).

### Changed
Merged the "registration", "rss_reader" and "tpl_editor" module into the core
modules ("backend" and "frontend").

### New
All front end modules of the core modules now use Models.

### New
Added lazy and eager loading of related records to the Model class. Usage:

```
$objArticle = ArticleModel::findByPk(5);

// The author will be eager loaded
echo $objArticle->author['name']; // Kevin Jones

// The parent page can be lazy loaded
$objArticle->getRelated('pid');
echo $objArticle->pid['title']; // Music Academy
```

Relations are defined in the DCA files.

### Changed
All core modules are now using namespaces and can thus be overriden.

### Changed
Ported the news extension into its own namespace. Note that this is completely
optional and does not have to be done with your custom modules! I am just doing
it so the classes can be overriden by an extension

### Changed
Use the TemplateLoader in the `getTemplate()` and `getTemplateGroup()` methods.

### New
Added a merge script (`contao/merge.php`) which automatically prepares Contao 2
extensions for Contao 3 by creating the `config/autoload.php` file.

### Improved
Much nicer debug output.

### Changed
Modules are now disabled by adding a `.skip` file instead of using the global
`inactiveModules` array. This way the local configuration file does not have to
be included twice in the `Config` class.

### Changed
Moved the Contao framework into the 'library' folder.

### Changed
Renamed the default configuration file from `config.php` to `default.php`, so
hopefully less people will try to edit the file directly.

### Changed
Moved the generated scripts to `assets/css` and `assets/js` and the thumbnails
to `assets/images`. Also moved the feed files into the `share` folder.

### Changed
Renamed the `tl_files` directory to `files`.
