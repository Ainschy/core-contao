Contao Open Source CMS API changes
==================================

Version 3.1 to 3.2
------------------

### buttons_callback

The "buttons_callback" was introduced in Contao 3.0 to add custom buttons when
selecting multiple records for editing. In Contao 3.2, this behavior has been
enhanced in a way that not only the selection buttons but any button set can be
altered as well as existing buttons can be removed.

We have decided to use the existing "buttons_callback" for this, because it does
not make sense to add another hook which essentially does the same. However,
this decision implies a backwards compatibilty break, since the API of the hook
has had to change as described below.

Usage in Contao 3.0 and 3.1:

```php
$GLOBALS['TL_DCA']['tl_page']['edit'] => array
(
    'buttons_callback' => array
    (
        array('tl_page', 'addAliasButton')
    )
);

/**
 * Button callback
 * @return string
 */
public function addAliasButton()
{
    return '<input...';
}
```

New usage as of Contao 3.2:

```php
// Add a button to the "select multiple" screen
$GLOBALS['TL_DCA']['tl_page']['select'] => array
(
    'buttons_callback' => array
    (
        array('tl_page', 'addAliasButton')
    )
);

// Add a button to the "edit record(s)" screen
$GLOBALS['TL_DCA']['tl_page']['edit'] => array
(
    'buttons_callback' => array
    (
        array('tl_page', 'addAliasButton')
    )
);

/**
 * Button callback
 * @param array
 * @return array
 */
public function addAliasButton($arrButtons)
{
    // Unset the save button
    unset($arrButtons['edit']);

    // Add a custom "alias" button
    $arrButtons['alias'] = '<input â€¦ >';

    // Return the array of buttons
    return $arrButtons;
}
```

In case you have been using the "buttons_callback", please make sure to adjust
your extension accordingly.

### Model registry

In Contao 3.0 and 3.1 it was possible to create two models for one database
record. In rare cases, it was possible that this data could be lost. We have
decided to drop the database cache (see #6070) and introduce a model registry.
The model registry ensures that there is only one model for one database.

But with the registry, we loose the `$blnForceInsert` flag of `Model::save()`,
that make duplicating a model really simple. From now on, you need to clone the
model that you want to duplicate first.

Usage in Contao 3.0 and 3.1:

```php
$objPage = \PageModel::findByPK(1);
$objPage->title = 'New page title';
$objPage->save(true);
```

New usage as of Contao 3.2:

```php
$objPage = \PageModel::findByPK(1);
$objDuplicatedPage = clone $objPage;
$objDuplicatedPage->title = 'New page title';
$objDuplicatedPage->save();
```
